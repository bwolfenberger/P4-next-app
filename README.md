<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Qwizard Screenshot](qwizardScreenshot.png)

Quizard is a quiz app to help with learning key concepts for computer science related topics.

I built this application as part of a three-day sprint with a new technology. Due to the short time, I needed to learn in an efficient manner.

Data parsing was also a big emphasis for this project which is why I wanted to use an API with many layers to the data.

### Built With

* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
* [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
